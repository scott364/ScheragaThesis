Force/Torque feedback now works.
end effector Roll/pitch/yaw works
Setting camera angles works 
I discovered my "hole" objects didn't have holes in the collision mesh. had to enable them in the urdf file. 

Investigated methods of locking red block to arm:

Initially attempted to combine using joinUrdf, initially appeared too complicated

Used CreateConstraint, but the constrained shape appears to "drag" behind gripper,
and block can get stuck outside of grippers entirely. 
Played around with p.setPhysicsEngineParameter(numSolverIterations=100, numSubSteps
to increase accuracy. I think it does, but if variables are too high- system is unstable. random things occur.

Investigated multibody, but it only appears to  work for primitives-
createCollisionShape- spheres, boxes, and meshes from .obj files

Potential solutions-maybe there is a way to incorporate friction or damping better 
with createConstraint? There are a lot of settings, I maxed many of them out with little effect. 

Or- possibly joinURDFs to integrate block into the arm's geometry.

or enable btGeneric6DofConstraint from Bullet into Pybullet?
