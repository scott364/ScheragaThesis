work on STL location generator

load stl

be able to click on items in stl viewer
put pieces of STL viewer together

assy viewer should be what we create assembly plan

double clcik on an tiem, pulldown menu as to how to categorize it
 
from STL file of taskboard- output each of the positons, highlight hole positons. Allow user to click on each hole, a dropdown menu appears of each of the potential hole sizes,

outputs either code or coordinates associated with hole type

draw trimesh

trimesh is in OGL utils 

do not modify main_template
james's final project is in exp_graphics 
--------------
run the following:
hg clone https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
-----------

1st main step Load stl into trimesh, draw_trimesh

cad processing -stl,-stl_reader SHOULD be able to load stls.
creates an STLMesh object, that I can iterate through, which belongs to the stl_reader library.


I should be able to use lines 22-30ish in cadprocessing-stl-readme.md
make sure line 20 works. -DONE

readme is an example usage

a 5 line C++ should work. 

a nextested for loop should be albe to load everything into a trimesh



to learn:
c++ pointers
